# Chromeless Sublime

  A SublimeText v3+ plugin to allow removing the titlebar of the window.


## Requirements:

* Dependencies:
* * enum
* * typing
* * screeninfo

## Features:
* Allows to make the titlebar toggleable
* By default binds to **CTRL+F11**. If **"replace_default_fs_shortcut"** is enabled, re-binds the original **F11** Fullscreen keyboard shortcut to **Ctrl+F11** and sets Chromeless to **F11**.
* Enable chromeless (titlebar-less) mode on new window (with **go_chromeless_on_new_window**) (works perferctly with the 'Hide Menu' plugin)

## Caveats/Known issues:
* Window is not movable/draggable
