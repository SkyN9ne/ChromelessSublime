# Chromeless Sublime

  A Sublime Text plugin to allow removing the titlebar of the window.


## Requirements:

* Sublime Text v3+
* Dependencies:
* * enum
* * typing
* * screeninfo

## Features:
* Allows to make the titlebar toggleable
* By default binds to **`CTRL+F11`**. If **`"replace_default_fs_shortcut"`** is enabled, re-binds the original **`F11`** Fullscreen keyboard shortcut to **`Ctrl+F11`** and sets Chromeless to **`F11`**.
* Enable chromeless (titlebar-less) mode on new window (with **go_chromeless_on_new_window**) (works perferctly with the 'Hide Menu' plugin)

## Caveats/Known issues:
* Window is not movable/draggable
* Since version 2.0.2 linux support has been dropped. If you still need linux support, you can install version 1.5.0 manually.
